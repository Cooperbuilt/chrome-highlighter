# The Better Chrome Highlighter
A small chrome extension to highlight webpages and persist those highlights in local storage 

Select text and hit CMD+S (or Windows+S) to highlight the selected text.
You can choose your highlight color by clicking opening the extension menu.
Highlights are saved locally, and can be revisited. 


**Installation:**

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer mode (top right)
4. Click `Load unpacked` (top left)
5. Select the directory where you cloned this repo

Now when you select text, you should see a new context menu item that lets you highlight the text.
